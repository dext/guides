# Slack guidelines

This page will acquaint you with how we use Slack in Receipt Bank. It's organized by topic. Please read it carefully and follow the instructions.

## Slack profile

[Your Slack profile](https://receipt-bank.slack.com/account/profile) is the first thing most of your coworkers see about you. Please fill it in neatly. It's best to fill in all the fields, but the following are mandatory:

* **Full name.** Use your real names here.
* **What I do.** This is shown under your picture in Slack. You can enter your official role or anything else that will help your coworkers understand what you do.
* **Phone number.** Please enter your phone number. Itâ€™s not going to be used, unless it's an emergency.
* **Time Zone.** It will help Slack and anyone who wants to contact you know what the time it is for you.
* **Role.** Enter your official role, as per your role description.
* **Location.** Where in the world you work from. Useful, since we're all around the globe.
* **Team.** Which team are you a part of.
* **Manager.** Enter the person you report to. If you are uncertain, that is usually the person you have your one-to-ones with. If you can't find them, they might not be in Slack yet â€“ make sure you fill it once they are.

**Upload an Image**. It makes Slack considerably more personal. Don't just put in any picture there â€“ use a photo where we can see your face and you can be identified. Bonus points if you manage to get in orange background with the Receipt Bank logo.

If you're an engineer, make sure **your username in Slack matches the one in GitHub**. If you don't have GitHub, you can ignore this.

## Channels

You should already be in the following channels. Please join them if you are not.

* `#general` â€“ Company-wide announcements and updates. What gets posted here is important, so we try to limit the volume of conversation and use threads, so that messages donâ€™t get lost.
* `#random` â€“ Fun stuff. Anything that is non work related to keep us connected and remind us to be lighthearted.
* `#hellos-goodbyes` â€“ Say hello. Introduce yourself here.
* `#all-hands-meeting` - Notes and recordings from all-hands meetings.

There are many channels for various topics, so it might be worth it to give a quick glance over the list and see if you're interested in any. But don't fret too much about it â€“ if you are needed somewhere, people will invite you.

## Creating new channels

Feel free to create new channels any time you will need to. Here are some guidelines:

* Separate words in the channel name with dashes `-`, not underscores `_`. Like `#baking-recipes` or `#feature-requests`.
* Always, **always add a topic to the channel**. Note that this can only be done after the channel is created. Anybody reading it should get a good sense of what the channel is about. And remember that not everybody is in your department, so make sure that you include enough context for everybody.
* Some channels are in Bulgarian. That's perfectly fine as Slack is very heavily used by the Engineering team in Bulgaria. Those channels have a ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ Bulgarian flag in the topic.
* Some channels are expected to be thread-only. This is indicated with the `:speech_balloon:` emoji ðŸ’¬.
* When your channel is not needed anymore, please archive it.
* Don't use private channels, unless you really, really need to. Weâ€™re trying to keep a culture of transparency here. All team channels should be public - if you find yourself in a private team channel, ask to archive it and create a new public one.

Keep in mind that channel names are unique, even for private channels. If you intend to create multiple channels for related topics, it is nice to prefix them with a single short word or abbreviation.

## Messaging users

Slack is intended for asynchronous communication. This means that people don't need to be in it at
the same time â€“ somebody can message you now you can reply later when you see the message. In
practice, this means two things:

* It's perfectly OK to message anybody at any time. They are neither expected to see it immediately
  nor to reply straight away. They can answer when they have the time or in between other tasks.
  Don't expect people to respond instantly.
* If there is an emergency, it's not the best way to get somebody's attention. That's why you had
  to fill in your phone number earlier â€“ if you need somebody right this minute, consider phoning
  or messaging them. Don't do this unless it's really important â€“ people need to be able to focus
  to get work done and interruptions are the productivity killer.

Apart from that, feel free to contact anybody about anything.

While we are at it, try to avoid the cardinal sin in Slack. It's sending a message with...

> Hi!

...and following by saying nothing.

Remember, Slack is asynchronous. If you wait for the person you need to be online on the same time,
you're breaking their flow. It forces them to constantly look at Slack so you two can be online at
the same time. There is nothing wrong with pleasantries (our HQ is in Britain after all), but
include why you are contacting the person and preferably something actionable for them to do. If
you have a question about the Automation Platform and you think you might want to have a meeting,
don't just say "Hi, can we talk?" or "Can we have a meeting later today?". Add some context and
some plan of action:

> Hey! I've been looking at the Automation Platform and I have a question. I'm wondering if directly
  processes 1Tap receipts, or if they need to go through Receipt Bank for Accountants first. Do you
  think we can have a meeting about that?

This is much better! It doesn't just give the other person context about why you are contacting
them â€“ it also tells them what your question is. This gives them an opportunity to prepare a bit
for the meeting, or even better â€“ answer you right there in Slack and have no meeting at all
(usually the best kind of meeting). Remember, the fewer interruptions we have, the more work we can
get done.

And that's all you need to know on messaging users.

## Statuses

Please use statuses only as means to communicate availability with the other team members. The two
most commonly used statuses should be ":palm_tree: Vacationing" and ":face_with_thermometer: Out
Sick". Occasionally it might be good to set a custom status if you're working weird hours or harder
to reach.

When you set your status to ":palm_tree: Vacationing", always edit the default text and say when
you'll be back, e.g. "Vacationing (back on Sept 25th)". This will be very convenient for people who
want to contact you as they'll immediately see when you'll be back. In addition to this, feel free
to use Slack's feature to automatically remove the vacationing status on a certain date.

Set a status only if your current situation is untypical and you want to communicate this to the
rest of the team. If you are always working remotely, there is no point in setting ":house: Working
Remotely". Also, please avoid setting status only to be cute or funny â€“ they should be used to
communicate availability with the team, not express moods.

## Still got questions?
