# Slack guidelines

Hi and welcome to Slack!

It's nice to have you here!

This document will acquaint you with how we do things around here. It's pretty big and we like to
keep it organised. Please read this document carefully and follow the instructions.

## Your Slack profile

Your [Slack profile](https://receipt-bank.slack.com/account/profile) is what your co-workers see
about you. Having offices around the globe tends to make us a remote company, so it's important
that your co-workers in far-away countries can get a good sense of you. Please fill in your profile
neatly. It's best to fill in all fields, but the following are mandatory:

* **First name** and **Last name**. Use your full real name here.
* **What I do.** This is shown under your picture in Slack. You can enter your official role here
  or anything else that you think will help your coworkers understand what you do.
* **Phone number.** Enter your phone number here. We won't use it, unless it's an emergency.
* **Time Zone.** Be sure to specify it – it will help show Slack what the time is where you are if
  they want to contact you.
* **Role.** This is your official role, as per your role description.
* **Location.** Where in the world you work from. Useful, since we're all around the globe.
* **Team.** Which team are you a part of?
* **Manager.** Enter the person you report to. If you are uncertain, that is usually the person you
  have your one-to-ones with. If you can't find them, they might not be in Slack yet – make sure
  you fill it once they are.

Please fill in all of the above in your profile. Fill in the other if you'd like.

The next step is to **upload a profile picture**. This is a **must have**, as it makes Slack
considerably more personal. Don't just put in any picture there – use a photo where we can see your
face and you can be identified. Bonus points if you manage to get in orange background with the
Receipt Bank logo.

Finally, if you're a developer or working with code, make sure **your username in Slack matches the
one in GitHub**. If you don't have GitHub, you can ignore this.

That's it – you're done with your profile. Let's look at some ground rules.

## Channels

For starts, hop in `#general` and `#random`. The first one should be for general Receipt Bank
related conversations. You can use the second for jokes, cat pictures or baking recipes.

There are various channels for various topics, so it might be worth it to give a quick glance over
the list of channels and see if you're interested in any. Don't fret too much about it – if you are
needed in a channel, people can easily invite you.

On the same note, feel free to open a channel any time you will want to have a conversation with a
broader circle of people. Just make sure you do the following:

* If the channel consists of multiple words, separate them with dashes (-), not underscores (_),
  like `#baking-recipes` or `#feature-requests`. In devspeak this is lovingly called "kebab case"
  because all the words look like they are all held together on a shish kebab.
* Always, always, **always set a channel purpose and topic**. The person reading it should get a good
  sense of what this channel is all about. Remember that not everybody is in your department, so
  make sure that you include enough context for the purpose to make sense to everybody. We
  occasionally prune channels in order to keep the list manageable and purposes are of big help.
  The topic is visible every time you look at the channel, so it should be a short reminder of what
  it is about. The purpose can have a longer description.
* Some channels are in Bulgarian. That's perfectly fine as Slack is very heavily used by the dev
  team and they have many channels. They don't follow a special nomenclature (which would be
  heavily inconvenient), but they will be indicated with a Bulgarian flag (:flag-bg:) in the topic.
* Some channels used by the Dev team are expected to be thread-only. They are indicated with
  the `:speech_balloon:` emoji (:speech_balloon:).
* If your channel has a lifespan (you want to have a conversation around a topic and once it's
  over, you're done – you may want to reach a decision in a group, for example), it's nice to
  archive once you're done with it.

Keep in mind that channel names are unique, even for private channels. If you intend to create
multiple channels for related topics, it is nice to prefix them with a single short word or
abbreviation.

That's all about channels. Now let's look into messaging users.

## Messaging users

Slack is intended for asynchronous communication. This means that people don't need to be in it at
the same time – somebody can message you now you can reply later when you see the message. In
practice, this means two things:

* It's perfectly OK to message anybody at any time. They are neither expected to see it immediately
  nor to reply straight away. They can answer when they have the time or in between other tasks.
  Don't expect people to respond instantly.
* If there is an emergency, it's not the best way to get somebody's attention. That's why you had
  to fill in your phone number earlier – if you need somebody right this minute, consider phoning
  or messaging them. Don't do this unless it's really important – people need to be able to focus
  to get work done and interruptions are the productivity killer.

Apart from that, feel free to contact anybody about anything.

While we are at it, try to avoid the cardinal sin in Slack. It's sending a message with...

> Hi!

...and following by saying nothing.

Remember, Slack is asynchronous. If you wait for the person you need to be online on the same time,
you're breaking their flow. It forces them to constantly look at Slack so you two can be online at
the same time. There is nothing wrong with pleasantries (our HQ is in Britain after all), but
include why you are contacting the person and preferably something actionable for them to do. If
you have a question about the Automation Platform and you think you might want to have a meeting,
don't just say "Hi, can we talk?" or "Can we have a meeting later today?". Add some context and
some plan of action:

> Hey! I've been looking at the Automation Platform and I have a question. I'm wondering if directly
  processes 1Tap receipts, or if they need to go through Receipt Bank for Accountants first. Do you
  think we can have a meeting about that?

This is much better! It doesn't just give the other person context about why you are contacting
them – it also tells them what your question is. This gives them an opportunity to prepare a bit
for the meeting, or even better – answer you right there in Slack and have no meeting at all
(usually the best kind of meeting). Remember, the fewer interruptions we have, the more work we can
get done.

And that's all you need to know on messaging users.

## Statuses

Please use statuses only as means to communicate availability with the other team members. The two
most commonly used statuses should be ":palm_tree: Vacationing" and ":face_with_thermometer: Out
Sick". Occasionally it might be good to set a custom status if you're working weird hours or harder
to reach.

When you set your status to ":palm_tree: Vacationing", always edit the default text and say when
you'll be back, e.g. "Vacationing (back on Sept 25th)". This will be very convenient for people who
want to contact you as they'll immediately see when you'll be back. In addition to this, feel free
to use Slack's feature to automatically remove the vacationing status on a certain date.

Set a status only if your current situation is untypical and you want to communicate this to the
rest of the team. If you are always working remotely, there is no point in setting ":house: Working
Remotely". Also, please avoid setting status only to be cute or funny – they should be used to
communicate availability with the team, not express moods.

## Still got questions?

If you have any questions about how we use Slack or you need help with setting something up, feel
free to message @skanev. He will gladly help you. ;)
